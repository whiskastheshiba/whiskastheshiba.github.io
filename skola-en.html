                    <h4>A little about school</h4>
                    <p>I devoted 12 years of my life to studies at Rēzekne 2nd secondary school. Why did I choose this particular school? First of all, in those days it was still possible to learn Russian in one way or another, and since my parents were Russian speakers and my mother tongue is Russian, the choice was obvious. Secondly, of all the Russian language schools available in Rezekne, the 2nd secondary school was the closest to home.</p>
                    <p>My mother also studied at this school. In addition, my older brother, who is 9 years older than me, studied at the same school, which made life easier for my parents, and he could sometimes pick me up from school, make sure that everything was okay, generally fulfill the duties of an older brother.</p>
                    <p>The school had a good reputation, many children and teenagers went to various Olympiads. 2. Rēzekne secondary school was very strong.</p>

                    <h4>School</h4>
                    <p>The first and second grades were just terrible academically, I was constantly sick and had to study at home, which caused a lot of tears and was difficult in general. While the children could communicate, play during breaks, spend time together, I spent most of the school year at home. But in the 3rd and 4th grade, I already caught up and quickly got into the top three students of the class, where I stayed until the 11th-12th grade.</p> 
                    <p>Elementary school was the best time of my life. It had everything - new acquaintances, first birthdays with friends, first best friends, with whom I am still friends. It was at that time that I got the closest people, with whom I have been walking side by side for more than 10 years. And, of course, the final - the graduation of the 9th grade was one of the most important events in my life, because I started communicating with almost the entire class and from that moment on, life changed drastically. I studied well as in elementary school, I was in the top 3 of the class, I passed the exams and then it was high school.</p>
                    <p>In high school, especially in the 12th grade, my studies were already a little worse, but I still studied well. They had their own interests outside of school. Parties, interesting Fridays and weekends with friends used to require time for studying. In general, school somehow went into the background. I can't say that high school was memorable for anything other than 12th grade. In a word, an interesting and fun time spent.</p>
                    <p>In the 12th grade, I had to decide what to do next with my life. Exams, choosing a university and my future profession - all this prevented me from living a normal life.</p>

                    <h4>The end of school</h4>
                    <p>There was little choice after school - do what you like or go to study. All in all, I needed 1 year to think (the so-called gap year) and just do what I like. I tried to find answers to my questions and understood myself, I was looking for what I might like. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://google.com" target="_parent"></a></p>
                    <p>Time passed, no new thoughts appeared in my head. Eventually, I decided it was time to go to university. But the problem is, which industry should I choose? At first I couldn't even think about computers, programming, I thought it wasn't for me.<a rel="nofollow" href="https://google.com" target="_parent"></a></p>
                    <p>At first, I thought about studying psychology and languages, I wanted to enroll in philology. After some thought, weighing all the pros and cons, I realized that neither one nor the other would give me anything in life and I abandoned these ideas. I tried a few programming courses before applying. And I found what I was looking for, I found a long-forgotten sense of interest. Back in school I had a Pascal programming course where I always got 9's and 10's and I thought why not give it a try?<a rel="nofollow" href="https://google.com" target="_parent"></a></p>
                    <p>In general, I applied to LU, not believing that I would also enter Rēzekne University.<a rel="nofollow" href="https://google.com" target="_parent"></a></p>
                    <p>Time passed, the competition began. I got lower and lower in the budget receptions. I got to the end and saw the cherished figure - I got into 220 out of 220 place. I couldn't believe it and immediately understood - it is a sign of fate and I have to go to Riga.<a rel="nofollow" href="https://google.com" target="_parent"></a></p>
