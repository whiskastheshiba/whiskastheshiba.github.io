                    <h4>Thoughts after exam</h4>
                    <p>As I said in the last block, I had a choice - psychology, philology and programming, so I chose. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://google.com" target="_parent"></a></p>
                    <ul class="saraksts">
                      <li>1) English philology LU;;</li>
                      <li>2) LU psychology;</li>
                      <li>3) LU Faculty of Computer Science;</li>
                      <li>4) Rezekne Academy of Technology (programming);</li>
                      <li>5) I don’t remember, but also something in philology.</li>
                  </ul></p>
                    <p>The first 2 points disappeared immediately, my rating was too low due to the fact that I did not pass the exam in Latvian and mathematics very well (46% Latvian and 54% mathematics), and the number of budget places there was much less (about 20 if not less ).<a rel="nofollow" href="https://google.com" target="_parent"></a></p>
                    <p>In the LU for a long time I was somewhere slightly below the average out of 220 (about 150 out of 220), but at the end of the competition I immediately went down and was already desperate, but oh god, I took 220 out of 220 in the 1st competition, and according to the results of the 2nd competition, in my opinion, I was in 200th or 210th place.</p>
                    <p>After that, there was still a thought - maybe I don’t need this Riga and it’s better to stay in Rezekne? In Rezekne, by the way, I could also enter the budget. But my friend quickly dissuaded me, saying that this was a sign of fate, that I was able to take the last place on the budget and I should definitely go to Riga. I am very grateful to her for this advice, if not for her, I do not know where I would be now.</p>

                    <h4>University</h4>
                    <p>Life at the university is not to say that it was very interesting. She was definitely exciting in terms of studying - new schedule, new responsibilities, exams every six months, difficult tests, a lot of preparation, homework, less free time.</p> 
                    <p>But if we talk about communication with classmates, some kind of socialization, then it was definitely not enough for the first 2 years. We were the first students who immediately switched to distance learning from the first year. Covid, quarantine, stay at home, curfew, boredom, the Internet - these are the words I would describe the period from 2020 to mid-2021. I did not suffer, but in my university life, the period of housing in a hostel, communication at the university definitely left, I did not appear in Riga for 2 years.</p>
                    <p>Of course, now everything has practically returned, although the first month was still remote, but this is not the same. All students somehow felt the burden of university life, someone has already reached the heights and does not come to lectures so often, we already have a division into streams. Perhaps I have lost some important contacts with those who have either left or graduated from college.</p>
                    <p>But in general, I am satisfied with my work done. Being in the 12th grade at school, I could not even think that the things that happened to me at the university would happen to me. I didn't expect myself to be able to go that far.</p>

                    <h4>What's now?</h4>
                    <p>Now what? I'm already finishing my 3rd year. Time flew by so fast that I'm just afraid to imagine how quickly the time will come to write a bachelor's degree and defend it ... But these are the little things in life. In general, I am satisfied with my life.<a rel="nofollow" href="https://google.com" target="_parent"></a></p>
                    <p>I completed my college degree, although by the time I started writing I was ready to leave the university. I don't know what happened in my head. Maybe I'm tired (because I combine the work of a tester with my studies), maybe I just lost myself. But I did not back down and nevertheless finished the qualifying work and am also going to finish my bachelor's degree. I am grateful to life, the universe, for giving me a chance to open up, I'm sure this is the beginning.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned earlier, I found a job. This happened in the 2nd year, when we had to look for a place for practice. It was hard for me, since I saw the work of a programmer and not to say that I liked it. Therefore, I decided to apply for a tester, I did not pass 2 interviews, but for 3 they took me to a great company and now I'm here. I study and work in Riga, although I was ready not even to enter the LU.</p>
                    <p>Life is an interesting thing, a person always chooses the path of least resistance, but sometimes you have to choose what the universe tells you. Where would I be now if I stayed in Rezekne? Would I have met such cool people at the university, at work? And would I continue to study at all? We will not consider these questions. You know, everything that is not done is for the better. Now I am satisfied with life, and I am grateful to everyone and myself for the support!</p>
